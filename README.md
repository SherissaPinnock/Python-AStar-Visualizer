A* Algorithm Visualizer

A graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the A* algorithm for finding the optimal path in a graph. Built using tkinter and matplotlib.

Features
Visualize the A* search algorithm step by step.
Custom input for the adjacency matrix and heuristic values.
Automatically generate random graphs.
Display the optimal path and cost.

Adjacency Matrix Format:
Input the adjacency matrix in the following format:

Rows are separated by semicolons (;).
Entries within each row are comma-separated (0,1,0).
For example, the following matrix:
0  1  0
1  0  1
0  1  0
Should be entered as:
0,1,0;1,0,1;0,1,0

Enter heuristic values as a comma-separated list.
Buttons:
Run A*: Run the A* algorithm based on user input.
Generate Graph: Generate a graph based on the input adjacency matrix.
Generate Random Graph: Automatically create a random graph to visualize.
